Ex Machina

On http://exmachina.asterisques.com, you can view a series of 100 acheiropoieta made via a GAN trained on a dataset of Byzantine Icons.

You may already be familiar with the Shroud of Turin, the Image of Camuliana, or the Mandylion.

As both a Christian and a technologist, I beg the question what does it mean to create without hands or human intervention in a modern sense?

I see parallels between the nonfungibility of tokens and that of Christian relics.  Relics were portable which means that you could bring them from village to village in order to share the miracles, though they could not be recreated.

No known acheiropoieta remain, only copies or representations of them do. Interestingly enough, in spite of not being the "original" icon, many believers pray to representations of these holy objects.
